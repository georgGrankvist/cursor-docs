# Research Codebase

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across the codebase to answer user questions by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings.

## Workflow Context

This command is part of the **Research → Plan → Implement** workflow:
- **Output**: `cursor-docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-TICKET-description.md`
- **Next step**: Use output with `/create-plan` command

## Initial Setup

When this command is invoked, respond with:

```
I'm ready to research the codebase. Please provide your research question or area of interest, and I'll analyze it thoroughly by spawning specialized sub-agents to explore relevant components and connections.

Output will be saved to: cursor-docs/research/
```

Then wait for the user's research query.

## Steps to follow after receiving the research query:

1. **Read any directly mentioned files first:**
   - If the user mentions specific files (tickets, docs, JSON), read them FULLY first
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **CRITICAL**: Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-agents
   - This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

2. **Analyze and decompose the research question:**
   - Break down the user's query into composable research areas
   - Think deeply about the underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications the user might be seeking
   - Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
   - Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all sub-agent tasks
   - Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

3. **Spawn parallel sub-agent tasks for comprehensive research:**
   Create multiple Task sub-agents to research different aspects concurrently.
   We have specialized sub-agents that know how to do specific research tasks:

   **For codebase research:**
   - Delegate to **/codebase-locator** to find WHERE files and components live
   - Delegate to **/codebase-analyzer** to understand HOW specific code works
   - Delegate to **/codebase-pattern-finder** to find examples of existing patterns

   **For historical context:**
   - Delegate to **/research-locator** to find existing research or plans in `cursor-docs/research/` and `cursor-docs/planning/`
   - Delegate to **/research-analyzer** to extract key insights from relevant prior documents

   **For web research (only if user explicitly asks):**
   - Use the **web-search-researcher** sub-agent for external documentation and resources
   - IF you use web-research sub-agents, instruct them to return LINKS with their findings, and please INCLUDE those links in your final report

   Invoke sub-agents in parallel using the Task tool:
   ```
   // Example: Spawn these concurrently using multiple Task tool calls in one message
   Task(prompt="Use /codebase-locator to find all files and components related to [topic]. Focus on directories: [relevant dirs].")
   Task(prompt="Use /codebase-analyzer to analyze how [system/component] works. Explain data flow and key functions with file:line references.")
   Task(prompt="Use /codebase-pattern-finder to find examples of [pattern] in the codebase.")
   Task(prompt="Use /research-locator to find existing research or plans in cursor-docs/ related to [topic].")
   ```

   The key is to use these sub-agents intelligently:
   - Start with locator sub-agents to find what exists
   - Then use analyzer sub-agents on the most promising findings
   - Run multiple sub-agents in parallel when they're searching for different things
   - Each sub-agent knows its job - just tell it what you're looking for
   - Don't write detailed prompts about HOW to search - the sub-agents already know

4. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete and synthesize findings:**
   - IMPORTANT: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete before proceeding
   - Compile all sub-agent results
   - Connect findings across different components
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
   - Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
   - Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence

5. **Gather metadata for the research document:**
   - Get current git info: branch name, commit hash
   - Determine appropriate filename: `cursor-docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-TICKET-description.md`
     - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-TICKET-description.md` where:
       - YYYY-MM-DD is today's date
       - TICKET is the ticket number if applicable (omit if no ticket)
       - description is a brief kebab-case description of the research topic
     - Examples:
       - With ticket: `2025-01-08-TEC-1478-parent-child-tracking.md`
       - Without ticket: `2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`

6. **Generate research document:**
   - Use the metadata gathered in step 5
   - Structure the document with YAML frontmatter followed by content:

     ```markdown
     ---
     date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
     researcher: AI Assistant
     git_commit: [Current commit hash]
     branch: [Current branch name]
     repository: [Repository name]
     topic: "[User's Question/Topic]"
     tags: [research, codebase, relevant-component-names]
     status: complete
     last_updated: [Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]
     ---

     # Research: [User's Question/Topic]

     **Date**: [Current date and time with timezone]
     **Git Commit**: [Current commit hash]
     **Branch**: [Current branch name]
     **Repository**: [Repository name]

7. **Add GitHub permalinks (if applicable):**
   - Check if on main branch or if commit is pushed: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`
   - If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:
     - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`
     - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`
   - Replace local file references with permalinks in the document

8. **Present findings and next steps:**
   - Present a concise summary of findings to the user
   - Include key file references for easy navigation
   - **Suggest next step**: 
     ```
     Research saved to: cursor-docs/research/[filename].md
     
     Next step: To create an implementation plan based on this research, run:
     /create-plan @cursor-docs/research/[filename].md [your task description]
     ```
   - Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification

9. **Handle follow-up questions:**
   - If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document
   - Update the frontmatter field `last_updated` to reflect the update
   - Add `last_updated_note: "Added follow-up research for [brief description]"` to frontmatter
   - Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`
   - Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation
   - Continue updating the document

## Sub-agent Spawning Best Practices

When spawning research sub-agents:

1. **Spawn multiple sub-agents in parallel** - use multiple Task tool calls in a single message for efficiency
2. **Use `subagent_type: "explore"`** for all codebase research tasks
3. **Use `model: "fast"`** for quick exploration tasks to minimize latency and cost
4. **Each sub-agent should be focused** on a specific area or question
5. **Provide clear instructions** including:
   - Which sub-agent type to invoke (prefix with `[codebase-locator]`, `[codebase-analyzer]`, etc.)
   - Exactly what to search for
   - Which directories to focus on
   - What information to extract
6. **Be specific about directories**:
   - If researching frontend, specify frontend directories
   - If researching a specific service, specify that service's directory
   - Include full path context in your prompts
7. **Request specific file:line references** in responses
8. **Wait for all sub-agents to complete** before synthesizing
9. **Verify sub-agent results**:
   - If a sub-agent returns unexpected results, spawn follow-up sub-agents
   - Cross-check findings against the actual codebase

## Important notes:

- Always use parallel Task sub-agents to maximize efficiency and minimize context usage
- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing research documents
- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers for developer reference
- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only operations
- Consider cross-component connections and architectural patterns
- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)
- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references
- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading
- Have sub-agents find examples and usage patterns, not just definitions
- **File reading**: Always read mentioned files FULLY (no limit/offset) before spawning sub-agents
- **Critical ordering**: Follow the numbered steps exactly
  - ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-agents (step 1)
  - ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing (step 4)
  - ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document (step 5 before step 6)
  - NEVER write the research document with placeholder values
- **Frontmatter consistency**:
  - Always include frontmatter at the beginning of research documents
  - Keep frontmatter fields consistent across all research documents
  - Update frontmatter when adding follow-up research
  - Use snake_case for multi-word field names (e.g., `last_updated`, `git_commit`)
  - Tags should be relevant to the research topic and components studied
